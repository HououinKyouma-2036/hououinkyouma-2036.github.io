Hi! I‚Äôm Lixing Guo, a passionate and innovative Computer Science and Statistics major at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I‚Äôm on track to graduate in June 2025.  I‚Äôm looking forward to push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in the fields of artificial intelligence, computer vision, and software engineering.

Since June 2024, I've been a Research Assistant at UCSB's [FourEyes Lab](https://ilab.cs.ucsb.edu/), where I engineered a real-time contextual object detection system leveraging YOLO-NAS and transformer-based visual language models. Beginning in January 2024, my journey at the [Bionic Vision Lab](https://bionicvisionlab.org/) has been equally rewarding, contributing to the [Pulse-to-Percept project](https://github.com/pulse2percept/pulse2percept) by developing deep learning models that enhance perceptual accuracy for epiretinal prostheses. 

Prior to my roles in university labs, I served as a Machine Learning and Software Engineer at the Fontier AI Typography Lab. There, I developed and validated machine learning solutions using optical character recognition models to precisely identify font types within images and boosted the productivity of art design communities.

My current interests lie in generative AI, MultiModal Machine Learning, object detection, and innovative machine learning solutions. Meanwhile, I'm enthusiastic about exploring more industrial opportunities in these fields as researcher or engineer.

I‚Äôm always excited to connect with professionals, tech enthusiasts, and anyone curious about the future of technology - to make the world a better place!
