## Honors - Academic 
- **UCSB Computer Science Distinction in the Major Program (DIMAP)** 
  - **Issued by:** UCSB Computer Science Department and College of Engineering  
  - **Date:** August 28 

  The Distinction in the Major Program (DIMAP) is a high honor in recognition of the academic scholastic achievement of students for working on projects outside of and beyond the CS major degree requirements. This highly selective program admits only 10 candidates from over 100+ applicants across two academic years. I focused on the research track within this program. For more information, please view [UCSB DIMAP](https://cs.ucsb.edu/education/undergraduate/special-programs)
