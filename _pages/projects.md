A Torch deep learning model of phosphene appearance for Epiretinal Prostheses, based on [Granley & Beyeler et al., 2021](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9629663)
- Developed a deep learning model for phosphene appearance in epiretinal prostheses, enhancing perceptual accuracy through parameter tunings and torch foward computation, and improving computational efficiency via spatial and temporal scaling algorithms
- Modulated visual perceptions of electrical stimulation on the retina based on exponentially decaying impulse parameters
- Converted models to ONNX format and deployed with ONNX runtime, facilitating modelsâ€™ availability to CUDA and Nvidia GPUs
- Designed test cases for models using Pytest to ensure the correctness of predictions and optimized runtime for PyTorch models
